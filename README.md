# X Marks the Spot? Applying Recent Keypoint Detection Methods to Paleozoological Landmarking

We tasked two supervised keypoint detection networks to automatically identify anatomically relevant landmarks on sheep bones. The results of the models were compared to manual labeling by a domain expert, yielding satisfactory initial results that provide a promising foundation for further research.
